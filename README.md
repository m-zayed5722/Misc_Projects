# Miscellaneous Projects Repository

### Welcome to my Miscellaneous Projects repository! This collection showcases a variety of small yet impactful projects that I've worked on, ranging from data analysis and visualization to machine learning experiments and web development.

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: SWAT Anomaly Detection]
In this project, I focused on processing and cleaning the SWAT dataset. I implemented unsupervised anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in the data. The project also includes comprehensive data visualization to enhance insights.

### [Project 2: Decoding Message using Pyramid Structure]
For this project, I tackled the challenge of decoding a file using a triangular method to achieve the desired 'pyramid' structure requirement. The approach involved processing an encoded text file, applying suitable algorithms, which included sorting, and finally printing the decoded message.
